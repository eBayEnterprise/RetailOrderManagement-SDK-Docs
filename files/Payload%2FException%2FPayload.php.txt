 * Provides a grouping of Payload-related exceptions.
 * (PHP doesn't allow you to catch more than one type of exception in a single try/catch statement,
 * so a superclass provides for the possibility that you might want to catch all Payload-related
 * exceptions at once. This could be YAGNI, but it's cheap.)
